New articles [generated by AI](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/13/openai-chatgpt-creative-writing) briefly outnumbered those written by humans online, but the two are now roughly equal, per [a new report](https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans) from SEO firm Graphite.

**Why it matters:** Researchers have long feared that if AI-made content online overwhelms human-created material, large language models could [choke ](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/28/ai-content-flood-model-collapse)on their own exhaust and [collapse](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/27/synthetic-ai-data-effects). 

**The big picture:** [A 2022 report from Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Europol_Innovation_Lab_Facing_Reality_Law_Enforcement_And_The_Challenge_Of_Deepfakes.pdf) estimated that 90% of online content would be generated by AI by 2026.

 * According to Graphite's analysis of 65,000 URLs that were posted online between 2020 and 2025, **** the percentage of AI-generated articles rose sharply after ChatGPT's launch in 2023.
 * The percentage of AI-generated articles in this data set briefly surpassed human-written articles in November 2024, but the two have stayed roughly equal since. 

**What they did:** Graphite used an AI detector called Surfer to analyze a random sample of URLs from [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/), an open source database of over 300 billion web pages. The database spans 18 years and adds 3–5 billion new pages monthly.

 * The pages had publish dates between January 2020 and May 2025 and were classified as either articles or listicles using Graphite's article [page type classifier](https://schema.org/Article). 
 * Articles were deemed AI-generated if 50% or less of the content was found by Surfer to have been written by a human.

**Zoom in:** Distinguishing between machine and human-written content is tricky. 

 * To evaluate Surfer's accuracy, Graphite tested it with its own sample of AI-generated articles and with a set published before ChatGPT's launch, which were likely written by humans. 
 * Surfer had a 4.2% false positive rate (labeling human-written articles as AI-generated) and a 0.6% false negative rate (labeling AI-written articles as human) for articles it generated with GPT-4o.

**By the numbers:** Content farms may also be learning that AI-generated content **** isn't prioritized by search engines and chatbot responses, according to a [second report](https://graphite.io/five-percent/ai-content-in-search-and-llms) from Graphite.

 * Graphite found that 86% of articles ranking in Google Search were written by humans, and 14% were generated by AI.
 * The pattern held across chatbots, too. 82% of articles cited by ChatGPT and Perplexity were written by humans, and only 18% were AI-generated, according to Graphite's research.
 * When AI-generated articles do appear in Google Search, they tend to rank lower than human-written articles.

**Yes, but:** Researchers told Axios that a definitive count of AI-made content isn't possible with today's tools and definitions.

 * It's hard to determine what content is AI-generated and what is human-generated because humans are increasingly [working together](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/humans-in-the-loop-ai) with AI.

 * There are so many different degrees by which someone might utilize AI in their work that it's challenging to definitively say something is AI-generated or not, a Google spokesperson told Axios.
 * "At this point, it's a symbiosis more than a dichotomy," Stefano Soatto, professor of computer science at UCLA and VP at Amazon Web Services, told Axios. 
 * Not all content created with AI is considered spam, the Google spokesperson said.

**The intrigue:** Common Crawl isn't the entire web, but it is one of the largest sources of training data for large language models.

 * As a result, some paywalled websites — where content is presumably human-written — are blocking Common Crawl from indexing their pages.
 * This could mean that the volume of human-written articles is even larger than what Graphite's data shows.

**What we're watching:** Clearly labeled AI summaries of closed, proprietary content do well in search, Graphite CEO Ethan Smith told Axios.

 * But it's a different story for AI summaries that are auto-generated by search engines.
 * [A Pew survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/01/americans-have-mixed-feelings-about-ai-summaries-in-search-results/) from last week found that enthusiasm for most AI summaries in search is modest: Just 20% of users say those AI summaries are extremely or very useful, and only 6% say they trust them a lot.

**The bottom line:** For now, humans still want to read content that is written mostly by humans.
