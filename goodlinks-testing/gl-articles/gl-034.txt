I have already built a setup in a H6 Flow RGB, but for myself it would have been too small. Previous H9 would have been an option, but I do not like the arrengement of the side fans in the plane of the mainboard. Then I have seen this in the Computex 2025 news, and fell in love at first sight. Just what I've been looking for. 

+ Price is somewhat horrendous, but hey, it comes with all the fans + the controller we need, and in the end, it looks marvelous. 

+ Quality is the usual nzxt level, keep up the good work guys. 

+ Air flow is just supreme, noise level can be kept down at low temperature (and I somehow love the turbine noise at startup when all the fans are released at 100% xD ).

+ Installation, hardware upgrade is a walk in the park, it's the most spacious case I ever worked with. 

+ It looks awesome!

Still some minor points for improvement: 

- Rear fan placement and implementation needs a second thought or two, it stands out in the wrong way - not as fluid and smooth in design as all the others.

- No in-house solution for GPU anti sag. Still had to find a 3rd party solution and that does not look so good. The nzxt vertical bracket would also look strange in this one, and not everyone wants a vertical GPU that hides most of the mainboard. 

- Cable management (cable holes) between the two compartment could be somewhat better covered. 

Due to pricing and the few little annoyances I would rate it 9,5/10, but no question about the 5 stars rating. Would buy it again. And personally can't wait a mATX version of this design. How about a H4 Flow RGB+? ;)
