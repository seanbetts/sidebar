Google has told advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its [AI](https://www.adweek.com/category/artificial-intelligence-2/) chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations.

In separate calls with at least two advertising clients, Google reps indicated that ad placements in Gemini are targeted for a 2026 rollout, though details on formats, pricing, and testing remain unclear, according to one buyer, who spoke under condition of anonymity in order to discuss the meeting. This buyer said the plan is separate from advertisements in [AI Mode](https://www.adweek.com/media/google-brings-ads-to-ai-mode/), Google’s AI-powered search experience launched in March.

Both buyers said Google had not shared prototypes or technical specifics about how the ads would appear in Gemini.
