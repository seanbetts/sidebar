After wowing CinemaCon with [an early look](https://gizmodo.com/new-footage-from-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-goes-heavy-on-silver-surfer-2000584993), this morning Marvel released the second trailer for _Fantastic Four: First Steps_. And if [the first trailer](https://gizmodo.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-marvel-mcu-pedro-pascal-galactus-2000558503) found them_conspicuously_ absent, then this one is is all about one thing in particular: if [this be doomsday](https://gizmodo.com/fantastic-four-movie-404-secret-website-free-comics-mcu-1851387394), and Galactus’ arrival on earth, then he must be_heralded_.

Yes, today’s trailer finally gives us a good look at [Julia Garner in action](https://gizmodo.com/fantastic-four-casts-silver-surfer-marvel-julia-garner-1851385714) as Shalla-Bal,_First Steps_‘ take on the Silver Surfer. Introduced in the comics in 1968’s_The Silver Surfer_ #1, there Shalla was the Empress of the utopian planet Zenn-La, and the romantic partner of Norrin Radd. In the comics, it’s Norrin who becomes the Silver Surfer, making a pact with Galactus (played here in _First Steps_ by [absolute legend Ralph Ineson](https://gizmodo.com/marvel-fantastic-four-galactus-ralph-ineson-villain-cas-1851467934)) to become his herald in exchange for the world-eater sparing Zenn-La. Although in some plotlines Shalla interacted with the power cosmic that granted to Norrin—notably using a fragment of it to restore Zenn-La after Galactus drained it as punishment for Radd’s defiance of him—_First Steps_ marks the first time she herself is being depicted as Galactus’ herald.

Shalla-Bal is not the only comics character this trailer “introduces” us to: we also learn that during the movie Sue is pregnant with her first child, and preparing to become a mother while navigating her and Reed’s realities as superheroes. This will, presumably, be Franklin Richards—a [one-time mutant](https://gizmodo.com/we-need-to-talk-about-franklin-1845725529), Franklin grows up to be an incredibly powerful reality-manipulation and psionic abilities, eventually fighting alongside his family and his sister Valeria as members of the First Family in his own rights. For now, it’s up to the Fantastic generation before him to save their Earth from Galactus’ threat… and, somehow, make their way across the multiverse over to the MCU’s prime reality in time for[_Avengers: Doomsday_](https://gizmodo.com/avengers-doomsday-cast-announcement-marvel-mcu-2000580951).

_The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ hits theaters July 25, 2025.
