The 2000 action role-playing game, Deus Ex, is getting the remaster treatment for its 25th anniversary on PlayStation 5. The remaster is being handled by Eidos-Montréal (Eidos published the original game) and Aspyr (the developer of the recent Tomb Raider and Soul Reaver remasters).

Deus Ex Remastered will feature improved visuals and controls, as well as some PlayStation 5-specific features like haptic controller feedback. The original game was renowned for how much agency it gives the player in terms of directing the story and how to tackle each encounter, leading to many different ways to play through the game.
