# Phase 8: Cache-First Sync (Kickoff)

- Move chat conversations + messages to a cache-backed store.
- Extend the store pattern to notes, websites, files, and ingestion (lists + detail).
- Keep streaming behavior intact while syncing store snapshots.
- Scaffold tasks store for future TasksViewModel integration.
