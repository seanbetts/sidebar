# iOS/macOS Tasks System

## Goals
- Implement native Tasks sidebar + main view for iOS/macOS with parity to web flows.
- Wire Tasks API, store, and view model to backend `/api/v1/tasks` endpoints.

## Plan
1. [x] Add Tasks models + API client, and wire into `ServiceContainer`/`AppEnvironment`.
2. [x] Implement `TasksStore` + `TasksViewModel` (list/search/counts, selection state, operations).
3. [x] Build Tasks sidebar panel (counts, areas, projects, search, new task).
4. [x] Build Tasks main view (sections, list rows, actions, repeat/due/notes/move/delete).
5. [x] Hook up selection syncing and refresh on app resume; add minimal polish.

## Notes
- Mirror web task list sorting/sections/repeat preview logic.
- Keep UI native while matching web functionality.
