# iOS App (SwiftUI)

This directory will hold the SwiftUI universal app once the Xcode project is added.

Suggested structure:
- `App/` app entry, DI container, environment config
- `Models/` Codable DTOs
- `Services/` network, SSE, realtime, cache
- `ViewModels/` feature view models
- `Views/` SwiftUI screens
- `Utilities/` helpers (dates, URLs, error mapping)

Note: This folder currently contains scaffolding files only.
